this is a working setup for local development with docker compose, for the backend and the database.
and a seperate docker container for the frontend.

### to run the backend

make sure to change ".env.loca" to ".env" and replace the values with your own.
you need to have aws access keys for the s3 bucket, and a mongodb connection string.
